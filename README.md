# AI-Image-Classifier
Conv Neural Network Image Classifier in python, pytorch and torchvision. This project uses deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. It uses both VGG19 and Densenet classifiers to transfer learning in order to predict different types of flowers. The application is portable over to a mobile device e.g. phone in order to capter images of unknown flowers in order to predict their names.

**Usage**
There are four files to use, one is the `train.py`, and the other is the `predict.py`, and two ustility files, namely `arguments` and `utils`.
